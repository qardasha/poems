We will all meet our fates,
A single drop and I am hooked, no more games--no more "check mate,"
I can no longer bear the wait--I am longing just for another taste...

I am blind but I can clearly see,
For it is not my eyes but rather my heart, for I have not yet set it free,
A drop of heavenly wine teaches me what it means to be,
Am I wrong to allow my pen to sing?

This wine of mine is not a drink,

Yet when I return in the morning it doesnтАЩt feel the same.
IтАЩm afraid; I know not what will happen next.
IтАЩm afraid; I canтАЩt seem to see my way.

My heart burdens mountains,
Relief, unable to reach it.
My only goal is to reach the gardens.
I canтАЩt seem to find a way to fit in.

IтАЩm a good liar, I can hide,
IтАЩm a good hugger, I canтАЩt fight,
ItтАЩs dark here, someone turn on the light.
I turned off my voice, no one can hear my cries.
How can I be sad when water wonтАЩt fall from my eyes?
Staying up all night, IтАЩm wondering тАЬWhy?тАЭ
Here under the dark night sky, I begin to write.
This is the product of a man who canтАЩt cry.
This is the only way his emotions can get by.

The dimly-lit night sky watches over me.
With every letter I pen, I am one step closer to being free!
I am blind, my heart refuses to see,
The way to be happy.
Ya Shafi! Heal this heart that's longing to be in glee!`

Water wants to drop from my eyes,
No, I don't want advice.
You forget I can no longer cry.
Tears won't ever drop from my tired and heavy eyes.

I stood up to see the whole world against me,
Oh, someone stand up and do something!
I was wrong! Don't leave me be!
Please! Now I can see!
Alone I am, with no one to stand beside me.

`These still nights I find myself alone,
Pondering nights of past.
I find myself all grown,
Grown tired of all the things that make me sad.

Here I sit, still the last man standing,
As I can't help wondering,
a ponder that turns into sudden wandering;
It's cold.

Here in the cold, where I am all alone, unable to sleep once more.
The soft rain begins to pour as my heart begins aching for more.
However, I know the truth, my destiny is to find love nevermore.
All the crying then the eventual acceptance, Oh how my heart is sore.

When I ask, "Why hast thou forsaken me?"
I remember, that I hast forsaken thee,
Have you ever wondered what it meant to be free?
Do you remember the times of we?
Perhaps there is something I seek,
And this longing is making me weak;
It's cold.

Here I am, wondering about thee,
Pondering what it meant to be,
It's cold.

A forsaken me writes and writes;
Oh but it's cold.
As I see you continue to fight and fight,
Here in the open cold.

It's cold,
without you,
It's cold.

Where have you gone?
Why have you not taken me with you?
Am I just a pawn?
Come back! Come back! Don't go far;
For it's cold, it's cold without you.`

Daughter without fathers, and how we wanted to be martyrs!

Free of all, that claimed to be our enemy!

Salute the commander, the chief of the navy!
Peace to the king, the king of the waves!
May he not lose his way!
May he not turn to gray!
May he always be in the fold of Islam!

`I am a poet, that poetтАУ
Here come the boats to row,
Row down these terrifying waters,
Trailed by calls of a crow
As we drift off farther and farther

тАУI am a poet, that poetтАУ
Life is not a gentle stream,
But rather a fierce ocean,
If you are not prepared for it
Then you are headed to nothing but problems!

I am a poet, that poetтАУ
The crow continues to call,
As you almost stumble and fall,
Perhaps it was not meant for your life to be so tall,
Yet I canтАЩt accept that youтАЩve lost
After all that youтАЩve fought.

I am a poet, that poetтАУ
Here comes the rain
That seems to calm your pain,
The pounding sounds seeming to call your name.
Lo! Do not falter!
Indeed this life is not something you can alter,
Yet I canтАЩt accept that youтАЩve lost
After all that youтАЩve fought.

Here in the rain,
Where we used to train,
Where we recited poetry to one another,
Now I only see you stumble and falter.
тАЬAre you okay?тАЭ
Sheepishly you say yes in nothing but dismay,
тАЬWhy must you lie?тАЭ
You stay silent.
Yet I know, тАШtis but how it is in your life
And the room keeps silent.

тАЬAre you afraid?тАЭ
You nod your head in dismay,
You say you are okay,
Yet you have gone astray.
Your boat is wrought with holes
Your clothes have many folds.

I am a poet, that poetтАУ
Here keep the rains, raining for 12 months
Ever since youтАЩve lost
IтАЩve thought about losing my tough.
AinтАЩt that, right?
That you have nothing left for this fight?
That youтАЩve shown all your might?
How dare you!
How dare you say that you canтАЩt renew?!
Already giving up?
Have you lost this much tough?
Your stream still has a long way,
Yet you are too caught up in your dismay,
That youтАЩve lost your okay.

I am a poet, that poetтАУ
That time when I saw you on that fateful day,
Your body hanging from the ceiling,
I knew that this land was not okay,
That you have gone too far astray,
But I was wrought with too many feelings.
To see you in that way,
When IтАЩve known you for so long
Yet you chose to leave this way
And even if I wanted to, for that I could not mock.

I am a poet, that poetтАУ
As others sleep peacefully,
You take away my sleep.
As others continued blissfully,
I canтАЩt even brush my teeth.
You could not handle your pain
Now I feel what youтАЩve felt.
Your cries at what youтАЩve failed,
How I wonder how youтАЩve dealt.

I am a poet, that poetтАУ
I realize that this world is wrong
That not many are as strong
I cry for my mom
There is nothing that could be done,
I simply must move on.

Yet I simply could not accept that youтАЩve lost,
After all, youтАЩve fought.

No one said this life would be easy,
Many of us simply are not ready,
ItтАЩs hard to keep our boats steady,
Sometimes we get too tired to row,
Yet the calls keep coming from the crow,
We have no choice but to keep going
Ever so knowing
That one day the crow will catch up.
Then all that we've worked for would be done.

I am a poet, that poetтАУ
тАЬEverything they say is correctтАЭ
Is what you say as you let their lies get to your head...
Like a needle on a thread,
Your life is straight ahead
Yet you decide to take it instead.

I am a poet, that poetтАУ
Writing down your stories,
To keep you living,
But you are just a memory,
Living rent-free in my head.

I am a poetтАж
Yet I was not prepared for your deathтАж
I continue to write rhymes,
About all the fun times,
But after all that I've read,
Never was I prepared for your death.

I am a poet, that poet.`

Giving a person a second chance is like reading a book twice,
You already know how it ends.
With the clock going tik-tok, how can you be sure thereтАЩs time to make amends?

Every day this world cries out,
тАЬOh son of Adam, you walk on me now but soon you will be inside of me!тАЭ
Is there time to sit and pout?
With the shackles of this world, when are we truly free?

Ah, how I have lost everything!
Oh, how I sprinkle the sand yet donтАЩt even have time for mourning!
Sleepless nights and then I hear the fabled wordsтАж
тАЬYour Lord has not forgotten you,
Nor is he displeased with you.тАЭ
Hearing the truth shatter did my years of workтАж

Woe! Woe to me for not realizing sooner,
Without He, I would be a goner!
Every breath is a mercy from him,
Yet it is so easy to fall into a life of sin.

My heart is so injured,
Exhausted of the games of evil.
How did I not know before,
This is all his will,
Oh, raise his banner!
For he is the best of planners!

Oh, did he not find me lost and guided meтАж
Oh, how his love is the way to be truly freeтАж`

To defend Qardasha with all his might!

His father shaded him on the days with no shade
His father made him the Jewel of the Crown

And I heard people weeping over me
But I am in a blissful garden
Allah has made spacious my space
Today I have met life
A life that cannot be understood by the one of understanding
Nor can it be imagined by the one who imagines
Today I have met security and safety
From worry, misfortune and sadness
Today I have met blissfulness
In a grave they find within it light
And my actions have availed me
And the two angels ask me
And I answer and get it right
And if the people saw my bliss and тАж.
And the tranquility of the grave of the best of them
They would have wished to be in his place`

`The Spears thrown
The cannons shot

The Emperor on his throne
The weather so hot

Soldiers marching at day
Mercenaries purging at night

In the month of May
Fighting for what they thought to be right

Knights charging despite the fright
Slashing using all their might
Their foes seeing a white light`
